# OAuth2 PKCE Implementation

In this repository, I, Salah-Eddine, a full-stack developer with expertise in Java and Angular, showcase my learning journey in implementing OAuth2 and handling authorization based on roles. Previously, I mastered the implementation of OAuth2, understanding how to securely authenticate and authorize users in web applications.

Recently, I've leveraged Spring Security within a Spring Boot application to establish an OAuth2 resource server, augmenting security and access control.

In addition to OAuth2, I have expanded my proficiency to include OAuth2 PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange). This adds an additional layer of security, safeguarding the authorization code flow from interception attacks.

## What I've Learned:

### OAuth2 Implementation:
üîí Authentication and authorization flow using OAuth2.  
‚öôÔ∏è Configuring OAuth2 clients and resource servers with Spring Security.  
üë§ Handling user authentication and authorization based on predefined roles.  
üîê Securing endpoints and resources with OAuth2 tokens.

### OAuth2 PKCE Implementation:
üîë Understanding the necessity of PKCE in OAuth2 authorization code flow.  
üîê Implementing PKCE in the client application to securely exchange the authorization code for an access token.  
üõ°Ô∏è Enhancing the security of OAuth2 authorization code flow against interception attacks.

## Repository Overview:
- **OAuth2DemoClient:** A client-side application demonstrating OAuth2 and PKCE implementation for accessing protected resources.
- **OAuth2DemoResourceServer:** A Spring Boot application serving as the OAuth2 resource server, showcasing protected endpoints accessed via OAuth2 tokens.
- **Other Files:** Additional configuration files and documentation to support the implementations.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the setup instructions provided in each project's README to configure and run the applications.
3. Explore the implementations and experiment with different OAuth2 flows and security configurations.
4. Share your feedback and suggestions for improvement!
